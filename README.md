# See You Later!

See You Later is a bookmarking tool suite for personal collections and sharing. In its most basic form, it's a command line tool for mainting a database of web pages, but it also includes a simple server for bookmarking from multiple devices or sharing bookmarks through an API. There is also a browser extension for Firefox which allows adding bookmarks to any SeeYouLater service.
